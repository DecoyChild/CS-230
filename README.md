Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room Client were looking to port their existing game, Draw in or Lose It from Android . They are interested in 
expanding to other platforms. They want to design a web-based game.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
Identifying the requirements and the design restraints.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The UML / Domain model rundown helped get a big picture of how the software interacts.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The Recommendations portion. I would take more time and consideration for each section. (it was a tough week)

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
It was easier once I was able to weed out what wouldn't work. Then I was able to focus on the aspects of what platforms would work. 
If you neglect the customer’s needs, then your product is useless to them. You will waste a lot of time on redesigning (if you keep the business). 
If the design intent is clear from the beginning, there is no need for guess work.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached this using the recommendations from the client. 
I would use the evaluation of each platform, client, server, and development side in the future. To get a feel for what is appropriate, it's a good
choice to see all your options in front of you.
